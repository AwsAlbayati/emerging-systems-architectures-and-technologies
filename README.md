# Smart Thermostat Project

## Overview
This project implements a smart thermostat for three different microcontroller architectures: Texas Instruments, Microchip, and Freescale. The thermostat system integrates various peripherals such as GPIO, UART, and I2C, enabling features like temperature reading, setpoint adjustment, heater control, and cloud communication via Wi-Fi.

The project involved creating a smart thermostat for three microcontroller architecturesâ€”Texas Instruments, Microchip, and Freescale. The thermostat, integrating peripherals like GPIO, UART, I2C, and task scheduling, read room temperature, adjusted setpoints via buttons, controlled a heater based on temperature, and communicated with the cloud via Wi-Fi. The goal was to enhance convenience and energy efficiency in heating applications by enabling remote monitoring and control.

To ensure code maintainability, readability, and adaptability. The project featured a modular code structure, clear variable/function names, and comprehensive comments/documentation. I adhered to coding standards, utilized version control (Git), implemented error handling, and established a testing suite for reliability. 

The skills transferable from this project include embedded systems programming, peripheral integration, wireless communication implementation, cloud integration, version control, and problem-solving. The emphasis on documentation and security awareness, alongside exposure to project management tools, adds versatility. The project's maintainability was ensured through organized code, adherence to standards, and thorough testing, fostering readability and adaptability.

## Features
* Read room temperature using I2C-connected sensors.
* Adjust setpoints via button inputs for each microcontroller architecture.
* Control a heater based on the temperature setpoint.
* Communicate with the cloud via Wi-Fi to send temperature data and receive remote commands.
* Modular code structure for easy customization and expansion.

## Getting Started

### Prerequisites
* Microcontroller Hardware - List of supported microcontrollers.
* Development Environment - Set up the development environment for each microcontroller architecture.

### Installation

* Clone the repository:
 ``` bash Copy code git clone https://github.com/yourusername/smart-thermostat.git  ```
